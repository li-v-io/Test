# The First Person
## An open source FPS controller for unity.

The First Person (TFP) is a user friendly, feature rich extendable first person controller built for Unity. I decided to start this project because recently unity's been missing a good free FPS controller, there used to be an acceptable one in the unity Standard Assets but now it seems that's been phased out. The majority of other solutions I have found either didn't have features I wanted, made design decisions I didn't agree with or just weren't free, so the only option I had was to build my own, and if I was going to build my own I wanted to build the best possible system I could.

## Key features of TFP:
- Almost everything can be disabled
- Customizable input axis/button names
- Walking, running and crouching are built in
- Sliding on slopes steeper than the Character Controller component's slope limit
- Tuneable Air control from none at all to full control
- Variable jump height based on how long jump is held
- Optional momentum system
- Custom extension system so you can build any functionality you feel is lacking (this is likely to be slightly redesigned soon)

This project is currently in a beta state and after months of user feedback I have a few ideas for things that need to be changed. Keep an eye out for more updates soon
